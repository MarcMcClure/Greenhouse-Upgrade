okay so i need the following for the MVP

Arduino Nano
DS18B20 Temp Sensor
12V→5V Buck Converter
assorted resisters
assorted LEDs
Bread Board
jumpers

logic

PLC inputs
	sensor bits
		upper temp high
		upper temp low
		lower temp high
		lower temp low
		humidity high
		humidity low
	buttons	(for version 1.2)
		manual mode button
		open vent button
		close vent button
		circulation fan button
		heater button
	safety
		vent open limit switch (Unpressed = 1, Pressed = 0)
		vent closed limit switch (Unpressed = 1, Pressed = 0)
		battery low

PLC intermediates
	vent should be open

PLC outputs
	vent motor (forward, reverse, or off)
	circulation fan (on, off)
	heater (on, off)

PLC Logic
	(upper temp high ∧ lower temp high) ∨ (humidity high ∧ ¬ upper temp low ∧ ¬ lower temp low)) -> vent should be open
	vent open limit switch ∧ vent should be open -> vent motor forward
	vent closed limit switch ∧ ¬ vent should be open -> vent motor reverse

	(upper temp high ∧ lower temp low) ∨ (upper temp low ∧ lower temp high) -> big temp diff
	big temp diff -> circulation fan on

	upper temp low ∧ lower temp low ∧ vent closed limit switch ∧ ¬ battery low  -> heater on

instructions on getting vs code set up for Arduino and ESP32-DevKitC
https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/tutorials/espressif32/arduino_debugging_unit_testing.html

I have not touched a microcontroler in a couple years so the goal for v0.1 is just to get the indicater LED to flash
